During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission — the one we were waiting since
last autumn, but the updates was confusing as it not included the full feedback from reviewer or
maybe editor?
Anyway, I believe the team, although bit delay and less communication at recent days, they really
tried best for paper and cooperation. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance
and efforts until the Springer link came finally last week, I think.
Also, kindly remind me please, if the doctor still plan for the acknowledgments section edit before
he sending again. Because I didn’t see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so.
Overall, let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future
targets
